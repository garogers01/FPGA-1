# FPGA
3x3, 9 cells(Logic Box) FPGA implementation In Verilog HDL. <br />
This is a very naive FPGA implementation in verlog HDL. This FPGA utilises 4 input LUT and 5bit channel width. <br />
Using these 9 cells any combinational or sequential circuit can be implemented. As of now I have implemented a 4 bit Full adder and this circuit utilises 8 Logic blocks(out of the 9 Logic Blocks available) of the FPGA. <br />
An array of FPGA is also possible by connecting together multiple units to implement complex boolean functions. <br />

# Switch Box
The switch box in our architecture was designed to route the signals in all the directions and is fully programmable.However, the signals arenâ€™t allowed to change lines during switching.The simplicity of the design gives it an inherent flexibility of variable channel width i.e at any point of time the channel width can increase or decrease with minimal changes in the switch box structure.

L0 can be connected to U0, R0 and D0 only, and so on for all the other data lines. The data flow in between the any two nodes is controlled by two D flip-flops which can be programmed at configuration time.So, for this architecture there will be 60 SRAM bits to configure.

#Logic Block

The BLE or the basic logic element of an FPGA consists of an LUT(Look up table) , 2 multiplexers and a D flip-flop. The LUT in this design is a 4-input LUT as numerous studies have shown that empirically 4-input LUT performance is better than other options.LUT is made up of D-Flip Flops and stores the truth table values of the boolean function to be implemented.A 16X1 MUX selects the corresponding value and forwards it to the next part of the BLE.the next part of the BLE has a D-Flip Flop for storing states. However, an auxiliary connection is also provided to bypass the D Flip-Flop in order to implement combinational circuits.
