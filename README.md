3x3, 9 cells(Logic Box) FPGA implementation In Verilog HDL. <br />
This is a very naive FPGA implementation in verlog HDL. This FPGA utilises 4 input LUT and 5bit channel width. <br />
Using these 9 cells any combinational or sequential circuit can be implemented. As of now I have implemented a 4 bit Full adder and this circuit utilises 8 Logic blocks(out of the 9 Logic Blocks available) of the FPGA. <br />
An array of FPGA is also possible by connecting together multiple units to implement complex boolean functions. <br />
