# FPGA
3x3, 9 cells(Logic Box) FPGA implementation In Verilog HDL. <br />
This is a very naive FPGA implementation in verlog HDL. This FPGA utilises 4 input LUT and 5bit channel width. <br />
Using these 9 cells any combinational or sequential circuit can be implemented. As of now I have implemented a 4 bit Full adder and this circuit utilises 8 Logic blocks(out of the 9 Logic Blocks available) of the FPGA. <br />
An array of FPGA is also possible by connecting together multiple units to implement complex boolean functions. <br />

# Switch Box
The switch box in our architecture was designed to route the signals in all the directions and is fully programmable.However, the signals arenâ€™t allowed to change lines during switching.The simplicity of the design gives it an inherent flexibility of variable channel width i.e at any point of time the channel width can increase or decrease with minimal changes in the switch box structure.

L0 can be connected to U0, R0 and D0 only, and so on for all the other data lines. The data flow in between the any two nodes is controlled by two D flip-flops which can be programmed at configuration time.So, for this architecture there will be 60 SRAM bits to configure.

#Logic Block

The BLE or the basic logic element of an FPGA consists of an LUT(Look up table) , 2 multiplexers and a D flip-flop. The LUT in this design is a 4-input LUT as numerous studies have shown that empirically 4-input LUT performance is better than other options.LUT is made up of D-Flip Flops and stores the truth table values of the boolean function to be implemented.A 16X1 MUX selects the corresponding value and forwards it to the next part of the BLE.the next part of the BLE has a D-Flip Flop for storing states. However, an auxiliary connection is also provided to bypass the D Flip-Flop in order to implement combinational circuits.

A logic block can be connected directly to 4 other connection boxes. So in order to decide that the input is taken from any one direction, I have given the 4 inputs from four directions to a 4-input 4:1 mux and the select line is a part of Bit-stream config. Similarly the output can be given in a particular direction using a decoder.The input to this decoder again comes from the Bit-stream config. So the direction from which input is to be taken and the direction in which output is to be given has to be decided while configuring the FPGA

The connection box is connected to two Logic Blocks and switch boxes or I/O blocks. <br \>
The connection box in our architecture consists of 35 SRAM bits which are used to connect each line of either of the logic blocks or both further to the switch boxes and are also used to provide input/output and output to logic units and IO box respectively.
